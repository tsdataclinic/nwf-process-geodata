Wildlife,Wildlife,Bird migration,Canyon,Raptor,,NREX,,,N,2009,Wyoming Game and Fish Department,Mapping Migration: Important places for Wyoming's migratory birds,"This predicted migratory concentration layer is not a substitute for field studies in specific locations where wind energy, or other developments are proposed. Actual impacts may be site-specific and depend upon the siting of individual wind turbines. These maps can provide guidance for such studies, suggesting target species and a stratification design for data collection in the area. Our maps can be applied to the mitigation hierarchy (Kiesecker et al. 2009) to identify locations where wind development poses significant risk to migrating birds, and to assist land managers and planners in mitigating impacts.

Conservation of migratory birds requires improved understanding of the distribution of and threats to their migratory habitats and pathways. Wind energy development poses a potential threat, which may be reduced if facilities avoid or mitigate impacts in migration concentration areas. However, a current lack of information on the distribution of migratory concentration areas in the western U.S. impedes proactive planning. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) developed deductive models of migratory bird concentration areas. Models were based on a synthesis of existing literature and expert knowledge concerning bird migration behavior and ecology, represented through GIS datasets, and validated using expert ratings and known occurrences. Our results were migration maps for four functional groups: raptors, wetland birds, riparian birds, and sparse grassland birds. Key factors included in migration models differed among the four groups, but included streams, topography, wind patterns, wetland size, forage availability, flyway location, proximity to streams, and vegetation type and structure. Experts rated all models as good or very good, and there was significant agreement between species occurrence data and the migration models for all groups except raptors. Our maps provide data to companies and agencies planning Wyoming wind developments. Our approach could be replicated elsewhere to fill critical data gaps and better inform conservation priorities and wind development planning.

Crucial/Critical,Habitat,WGFD Terrestrial,,Terrestrial Crucial Habitat Priorities ,X,NREX,High,,N,2023,Wyoming Game and Fish Department,Terrestrial Crucial Habitat Priorities ,"The data set was developed to communicate to the public and other entities 1) areas that need to be protected or conserved to maintain viable healthy populations of terrestrial and aquatic wildlife for the present and future, 2) areas where there is a high potential in the 5 years after the Statewide Habitat Plan is published to successfully address wildlife habitat issues by improving, enhancing, or restoring wildlife habitats, and 3) migration corridors and fish passages that need to be protected or enhanced to maintain or improve connectivity.

This data set provides the location of habitat priority areas in Wyoming developed as part of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department Statewide Habitat Plan (SHP, revised November 2020). Priority areas were developed by regional teams led by aquatic and terrestrial biologists. Three sets of habitat priority areas were developed in each region: ""crucial"" areas, ""restoration"" areas and ""connectivity"" areas. This data set contains only the terrestrial crucial priority areas. See Statewide Habitat Plan 2020 for explanations of crucial, restoration, and connectivity. Short narratives available with the datasets summarize habitat values/issues, elaborate on why each area was selected, identify associated wildlife species, and identify solutions or actions to address the values/issues. Habitat priority areas are updated and published annually on January 31, as detailed in the SHP.

In general, the ACEC dataset defines areas within the public lands where special management attention is required to protect and prevent irreparable damage to important historic, cultural, or scenic values, fish and wildlife resources or other natural systems or processes, or to protect life and safety from natural hazards.

This polygon feature class shows the spatial extent and boundaries of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern that have become officially designated by the BLM. These polygon features were previously in a pre-designated status (i.e. being considered as areas to be eventually designated as official ACEC designated polygons). Once these polygon feature left the Pre-Designated phase (transitioned from a Considered to Designated status), they were removed from the ACEC Pre-designated polygon feature class and placed in this ACEC Designated polygon feature class. This dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Implementation Guide represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived.",,geodatabase,vector,file,https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/11c9e34831c7446a8202b334bc64898a/about,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/11c9e34831c7446a8202b334bc64898a/data,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/11c9e34831c7446a8202b334bc64898a/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html,

Actual impacts may be site-specific and depend upon the siting of individual wind turbines. These maps can provide guidance for such studies, suggesting target species and a stratification design for data collection in the area. Our maps can be applied to the mitigation hierarchy (Kiesecker et al. 2009) to identify locations where wind development poses significant risk to migrating birds, and to assist land managers and planners in mitigating impacts.

Conservation of migratory birds requires improved understanding of the distribution of and threats to their migratory habitats and pathways. Wind energy development poses a potential threat, which may be reduced if facilities avoid or mitigate impacts in migration concentration areas. However, a current lack of information on the distribution of migratory concentration areas in the western U.S. impedes proactive planning. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) developed deductive models of migratory bird concentration areas. Models were based on a synthesis of existing literature and expert knowledge concerning bird migration behavior and ecology, represented through GIS datasets, and validated using expert ratings and known occurrences. Our results were migration maps for four functional groups: raptors, wetland birds, riparian birds, and sparse grassland birds. Key factors included in migration models differed among the four groups, but included streams, topography, wind patterns, wetland size, forage availability, flyway location, proximity to streams, and vegetation type and structure. Experts rated all models as good or very good, and there was significant agreement between species occurrence data and the migration models for all groups except raptors. Our maps provide data to companies and agencies planning Wyoming wind developments. Our approach could be replicated elsewhere to fill critical data gaps and better inform conservation priorities and wind development planning.

These data were submitted to the BLM’s Wildlife Habitat Spatial Analysis Lab in March 2016 and were updated for UT in April of 2017, WY in October of 2017 (Lander and Bighorn EIS) and May 2022 (Buffalo and NinePlan EIS); NW CO in February of 2020, NVCA in July 2022, HiLine (GHMA only) in July 2022, and Oregon in August 2022. All of the data used to create this file was submitted by the EIS. Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) employed by the Wildlife Habitat Spatial Analysis lab was limited to: ensuring that the submitted data did not span the EIS boundary and ensuring that the submitted habitat data did not contain overlaps between various habitat management area designations. The EIS is solely responsible for the content and quality of submitted data used to create this file. The habitat data submitted by an EIS was identified by the EIS name and alternative through the addition and calculation of the EIS_HAB field. The EIS_HAB field calculation was performed according to the following template: For Priority habitat: “EIS Name”_""PH""_“ROD”. For General habitat: “EIS Name”_""GH""_“ROD” or “EIS Name”_""IH""_“ROD” (representing Idaho's Important Habitat Management Areas). Restoration Habitat management Areas (RHMAs) for Montana, Linkage Connectivity Habitat Management Areas (LCHMAs) for CO, Other Habitat management Areas (OHMAs) for NVCA and Anthro Mountain for Utah were also included and calculated within the EIS_HAB field. The updated habitat delineations for CO include Undesignated Habitat (UDH) to address concerns surrounding the management of privately held irrigated agricultural lands. The BLM's NWCO Sage-Grouse Plan has no management decisions associated with this habitat designation. The Hab_Type field was calculated from the EIS_HAB field, and includes the following: PHMA, GHMA, IHMA, RHMA, OHMA, LCHMA, Anthro Mtn, and UDH....

This dataset represents the consolidated submissions of GRSG habitat management areas from each individual BLM ARMP & ARMPA/Records of Decision (ROD) and for subsequent updates. These data were submitted to the BLM’s Wildlife Habitat Spatial Analysis Lab in March 2016 and were updated for UT in April of 2017, WY in October of 2017 (Lander and Bighorn EIS) and May 2022 (Buffalo and NinePlan EIS); CO in February of 2020, NVCA in July 2022, HiLine (GHMA only) in July 2022, and Oregon in August 2022.

August 2022 Update: OR - New habitat data was submitted by Oregon EIS as part of the Allocation Decision Analysis data call in 2022. Data that was submitted earlier was updated to reflect SFA designations in Aug 2022.


July 2022 Update: NVCA and HiLine (GHMA only) - New habitat data was submitted by NVCA and HiLine EISs as part of the Allocation Decision Analysis data call in 2022.


May 2022 Update: WY - New habitat data was submitted by Wyoming EISs Buffalo and Nine Plan as part of the Allocation Decision Analysis data call in 2022.


February 2020 Update: CO - In February 2016, the Associated Governments of Northwest Colorado (AGNC) hired a consultant (Olsson) to help further refine CPW’s greater sage-grouse habitat maps in Northwest Colorado. The Olsson consultation team, have utilized CPW’s contemporary and rigorous habitat models and developed their own to produce revised PHMA and GHMA habitat data. These spatial datasets (i.e., habitat maps) are specifically designed to meet the management intent of the ARMPA and have been produced for formal submittal to the BLM for incorporation into Northwest Colorado Land and Resource Management Plans. The updated habitat delineations for NWCO include Undesignated Habitat (UDH) to address concerns surrounding the management of privately held irrigated agricultural lands. The BLM's NWCO Sage-Grouse Plan has no management decisions associated with this habitat designation.


October 2017 Update: WY - On October 27, 2017 the WY state director signed maintenance actions for the Wyoming Sage-Grouse ARMPA, Buffalo RMP, Cody RMP, and Worland RMP that changed WY PHMA boundaries, bringing them into consistency with the Wyoming Core Areas (version 4) from the current Governor's executive order 2015-4. The updated PHMA boundaries were also adopted by the Lander RMP.


April 2017 Update: UT - The interagency team reconvened in late 2016 to review State of Utah GRSG populations and the BLM’s 2015 and 2016 wildfire data. Of the ten soft triggers and seven hard triggers evaluated, only one population soft trigger and one population hard trigger have been met, both within the Sheeprocks population area of Fillmore and Salt Lake Field Offices. Appendix I of the ARMPA includes “hard-wired” changes in management that were finalized in the 2015 Record of Decision, listed in Appendix I Table I.1 (Specific Management Responses). The PHMA in the Sheeprocks population has changed as a result of this, and the change is reflected in this data.


The following habitat management areas were used in the creation of this feature class:

PHMA: Areas identified as having the highest habitat value for maintaining sustainable GRSG populations and include breeding, late brood-rearing, and winter concentration areas.

GHMA: Areas that are occupied seasonally or year-round and are outside of PHMAs.

IHMA: Areas in Idaho that provide a management buffer for and that connect patches of PHMAs. IHMAs encompass areas of generally moderate to high habitat value habitat or populations but that are not as important as PHMAs.

OHMA: Areas in Nevada and Northeastern California, identified as unmapped habitat in the Proposed RMP/Final EIS, that are within the Planning Area and contain seasonal or connectivity habitat areas.

RHMA: Areas in Montana EISs with ongoing or imminent impacts containing substantial and high-quality GRSG habitat that historically supported sustainable GRSG populations. Management actions would emphasize restoration for the purpose of establishing or restoring sustainable GRSG populations. Areas are delineated using key, core, and connectivity data or maps and other resource information.

LCHMA: Areas in CO EIS that have been identified as broader regions of connectivity important to facilitate the movement of GRSG and maintain ecological processes.

UDH: In CO EIS, An Undesignated Habitat management prescription was developed to address concerns surrounding the management of privately held irrigated agricultural lands.

Anthro Mountain: An additional 41,200 acres of National Forest System lands in the Anthro Mountain portion of the Carbon Population Area in Utah EIS that are managed as neither PHMA nor GHMA. These areas are identified as “Anthro Mountain.” In the BLM’s ARMPA, these areas are considered split-estate, where the BLM merely administers the mineral estate.",https://gis.blm.gov,geojson,,vector,api,https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/BLM-EGIS::blm-natl-westernus-grsg-rod-habitat-mgmt-areas-august-2022/about,https://services1.arcgis.com/KbxwQRRfWyEYLgp4/arcgis/rest/services/BLM_Natl_WesternUS_GRSG_ROD_Habitat_Mgmt_Areas_August_2022/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/6e52a7e67456488495463965f03df7f5/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html,"These data are provided by Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 'as is' and might contain errors or omissions.

Administrative,Administrative,BLM,,Wilderness Study Areas ,,NREX,,,,,2024,Bureau of Land Management,BLM Natl NLCS Wilderness Study Areas ,"his dataset contains the polygons that define the boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Study Areas and Other Related Lands. In June 2000, the BLM responded to growing concern over the loss of open space by creating the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NLCS brings into a single system some of the BLM's premier designations. The Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, and Other Related Lands represent three of these eleven premier designations. By putting these lands into an organized system, the BLM hopes to increase public awareness of these areas' scientific, cultural, educational, ecological and other values. The data standard for these boundaries will assist in the management of all eleven designations within the NLCS. Particularly, NLCS data pertains to the following BLM groups and their purposes: Land Use Planners, GIS Specialists, NLCS team leads, BLM managers, and public stakeholder groups.

Feature Class for the BLM Wilderness Study Areas and BLM Other Related Lands data covered by the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Data Standard. In particular, this feature class includes the polygon features representing the spatial extent and boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Study Areas. A Wilderness is a special place where the earth and its community of life are essentially undisturbed; they retain a primeval character, without permanent improvements and generally appear to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature. In 1964, Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act. The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directed the Bureau to inventory and study its roadless areas for wilderness characteristics. To be designated as a Wilderness Study Area, an area has to have the following characteristics: Size - roadless areas of at least 5,000 acres of public lands or of a manageable size; Naturalness - generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature; Opportunities - provides outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation. In addition, Wilderness Study Areas often have special qualities such as ecological, geological, educational, historical, scientific and scenic values. BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Other Related Lands are lands not in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas that have been determined to have wilderness character through inventory or land use planning. These lands fall into one of two categories. The first category are lands with ""wilderness value and characteristics"". These are inventoried areas not in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas that have been determined to meet the size, naturalness, and the outstanding solitude and/or the outstanding primitive and unconfined recreation criteria. The second category are ""wilderness characteristic protection areas"". These are former lands with ""wilderness value and characteristics"" where a plan decision has been made to protect them.

Climate Change Indicators,Climate Features,Wildfire,Canyon,RPS WY,,,,,Raster provided as-is,N,2020,US Forest Service,Wildfire Risk to Communities: Spatial datasets of landscape-wide wildfire risk components for the United States (2nd Edition),"The data included in this publication depict the 2024 version of components of wildfire risk for all lands in the United States that: 1) are landscape-wide (i.e., measurable at every pixel across the landscape); and 2) represent in situ risk - risk at the location where the adverse effects take place on the landscape.

National wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire intensity, generated by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station and Pyrologix LLC, form the foundation of the Wildfire Risk to Communities data. Vegetation and wildland fuels data from LANDFIRE 2020 (version 2.2.0) were used as input to two different but related geospatial fire simulation systems. Annual burn probability was produced with the USFS geospatial fire simulator (FSim) at a relatively coarse cell size of 270 meters (m). To bring the burn probability raster data down to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to communities, we upsampled them to the native 30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data. In this upsampling process, we also spread values of modeled burn probability into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels data as non-burnable. Burn probability rasters represent landscape conditions as of the end of 2020. Fire intensity characteristics were modeled at 30 m resolution using a process that performs a comprehensive set of FlamMap runs spanning the full range of weather-related characteristics that occur during a fire season and then integrates those runs into a variety of results based on the likelihood of those weather types occurring. Before the fire intensity modeling, the LANDFIRE 2020 data were updated to reflect fuels disturbances occurring in 2021 and 2022. As such, the fire intensity datasets represent landscape conditions as of the end of 2022. Additional methodology documentation is provided in a methods document (\Supplements\WRC_V2_Methods_Landscape-wideRisk.pdf) packaged in the data download.

The scenarios products are described below.

Maps are presented for one historical and three future scenario products:

“Historical Climate” product — Averages from 32 model simulations of the 1976–2005 climate.
“Lower Emissions” product — Averages from 32 model simulations under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario.
“Higher Emissions” product — Averages from 32 model simulations under the RCP8.5 scenario.
“Upper Bound” product, temperature-derived variables — Averages from the warmest three models (for the continental United States and adjacent portions of Canada and Mexico) at the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The three models are consistent across all variables and were determined as those producing the largest daily average temperature increase for 2070–2099 compared to 1976–2005.
“Upper Bound” product, precipitation-derived variables — Averages from the wettest three models (for the continental United States and adjacent portions of Canada and Mexico) at the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The three models are consistent across all variables and were determined as those producing the highest single day precipitation increase for 2070–2099 compared to 1976–2005.
The “Historical Climate”, “Lower Emissions”, and “Higher Emissions” maps use model-weighted averaging based on model performance in simulating the current climatology. The “Upper Bound” maps use equal model weighting.

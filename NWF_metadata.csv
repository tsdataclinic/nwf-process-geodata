Wildlife,Wildlife,Bird migration,Canyon,Raptor,,NREX,,,N,2009,Wyoming Game and Fish Department,Mapping Migration: Important places for Wyoming's migratory birds,"This predicted migratory concentration layer is not a substitute for field studies in specific locations where wind energy, or other developments are proposed. Actual impacts may be site-specific and depend upon the siting of individual wind turbines. These maps can provide guidance for such studies, suggesting target species and a stratification design for data collection in the area. Our maps can be applied to the mitigation hierarchy (Kiesecker et al. 2009) to identify locations where wind development poses significant risk to migrating birds, and to assist land managers and planners in mitigating impacts.

Conservation of migratory birds requires improved understanding of the distribution of and threats to their migratory habitats and pathways. Wind energy development poses a potential threat, which may be reduced if facilities avoid or mitigate impacts in migration concentration areas. However, a current lack of information on the distribution of migratory concentration areas in the western U.S. impedes proactive planning. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) developed deductive models of migratory bird concentration areas. Models were based on a synthesis of existing literature and expert knowledge concerning bird migration behavior and ecology, represented through GIS datasets, and validated using expert ratings and known occurrences. Our results were migration maps for four functional groups: raptors, wetland birds, riparian birds, and sparse grassland birds. Key factors included in migration models differed among the four groups, but included streams, topography, wind patterns, wetland size, forage availability, flyway location, proximity to streams, and vegetation type and structure. Experts rated all models as good or very good, and there was significant agreement between species occurrence data and the migration models for all groups except raptors. Our maps provide data to companies and agencies planning Wyoming wind developments. Our approach could be replicated elsewhere to fill critical data gaps and better inform conservation priorities and wind development planning.

Habitat,Habitat,WGFD Terrestrial,Canyon,Terrestrial Restoration Habitat Priorities ,,NREX,,,N,2021,Wyoming Game and Fish Department,Terrestrial Restoration Habitat Priorities ,"The data set was developed to communicate to the public and other entities 1) areas that need to be protected or conserved to maintain viable healthy populations of terrestrial and aquatic wildlife for the present and future, 2) areas where there is a high potential in the 5 years after the Statewide Habitat Plan is published to successfully address wildlife habitat issues by improving, enhancing, or restoring wildlife habitats, and 3) migration corridors and fish passages that need to be protected or enhanced to maintain or improve connectivity.

This data set provides the location of habitat priority areas in Wyoming developed as part of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department Statewide Habitat Plan (SHP, revised November 2020). Priority areas were developed by regional teams led by aquatic and terrestrial biologists. Three sets of habitat priority areas were developed in each region: ""crucial"" areas, ""restoration"" areas and ""connectivity"" areas. This data set contains only the terrestrial restoration priority areas. See Statewide Habitat Plan 2020 for explanations of crucial, restoration, and connectivity. Short narratives available with the datasets summarize habitat values/issues, elaborate on why each area was selected, identify associated wildlife species, and identify solutions or actions to address the values/issues. Habitat priority areas are updated and published annually on January 31, as detailed in the SHP. For more information on SHP Priority Areas go to https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Habitat/Habitat-Plans/Habitat-Priority-Areas.

the U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program website and server 
(http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/ ), and not indirectly through 
other sources which may have changed the data in some way. It is also 
strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of 
the metadata file associated with these data 
(http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/metadata/ ). The U.S. Geological
 Survey and all contributing data partners and aggregators shall not be 
held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or 
contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or 
uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive 
to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. 
However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be
 used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate 
and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should 
serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be 
supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will 
provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, 
field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the 
responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer 
the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that 
question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is 
impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several 
possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use 
constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for
 a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in 
counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general 
list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide
 biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making 
-National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, 
management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, 
management or policy making -Public health planning, research, 
management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area 
resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential 
impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on 
biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness 
proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption 
proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. 
-Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific 
biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative 
management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of 
plants and animals and to help target both specific species and 
geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment 
for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential 
economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. 
-Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. 
Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than 
inappropriate ones, however, there is a ""fuzzy line"" that is eventually 
crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of 
geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for
 the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the 
data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically 
requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial 
photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. 
-Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to 
produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal 
measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares 
-Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. 
-Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for 
an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of
 any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by 
comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and 
redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without 
acquiring and reviewing the metadata."

For each HUC-10 flagged for presence of one of these species or stream reaches, the appropriate cell was coded ""1""; all absences were coded ""0"". Aquatic (fish) SGCN distributions were updated for the 2017 State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP); Conservation Status Tiers 1/2/3 represent a combination of SGCN species population trends, potential threats and other variables that reflect a species' conservation priority; Blue/Red Ribbon stream reaches are based on cold-water fisheries productivity, where Blue Ribbon stream reaches have 600 or more pounds of trout per stream mile and Red Ribbon stream reaches have between 300-599 pounds of trout per stream mile.

The scenarios products are described below.

Maps are presented for one historical and three future scenario products:

“Historical Climate” product — Averages from 32 model simulations of the 1976–2005 climate.
“Lower Emissions” product — Averages from 32 model simulations under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario.
“Higher Emissions” product — Averages from 32 model simulations under the RCP8.5 scenario.
“Upper Bound” product, temperature-derived variables — Averages from the warmest three models (for the continental United States and adjacent portions of Canada and Mexico) at the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The three models are consistent across all variables and were determined as those producing the largest daily average temperature increase for 2070–2099 compared to 1976–2005.
“Upper Bound” product, precipitation-derived variables — Averages from the wettest three models (for the continental United States and adjacent portions of Canada and Mexico) at the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The three models are consistent across all variables and were determined as those producing the highest single day precipitation increase for 2070–2099 compared to 1976–2005.
The “Historical Climate”, “Lower Emissions”, and “Higher Emissions” maps use model-weighted averaging based on model performance in simulating the current climatology. The “Upper Bound” maps use equal model weighting.
